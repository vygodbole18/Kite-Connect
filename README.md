#  Kite Options Bot (Zerodha)

A fully functional, trigger-based options trading bot built using the Zerodha Kite Connect API.  
This bot allows users to define a stock, a trigger price, and a target option to buy/sell when that price is reached.

---

## Features

- ‚úÖ Buy or Sell options when a stock hits a defined trigger price  
- ‚úÖ Automatically fetches the correct lot size  
- ‚úÖ Places smart **LIMIT orders** simulating market orders (+/- 0.25% from LTP)  
- ‚úÖ Tracks both **LTP and OHLC** for better trigger accuracy  
- ‚úÖ Fully modular: split into `main`, `auth`, `watcher`, `trigger`, `buy`, and `sell`  

---

##  How It Works

1. User provides:
   - Stock to monitor (e.g., `RELIANCE`)
   - Trigger price (e.g., `1400`)
   - Action (`BUY` or `SELL`)
   - Option symbol (e.g., `RELIANCE25MAY1460CE`)
2. `watcher.py` continuously checks the stock's LTP and OHLC  
3. When the trigger is hit:
   - `buy.py` or `sell.py` is invoked
   - Order is placed using proper lot size and smart limit pricing
4. Order status is monitored until complete or failed
